I‚Äôve actually come across this same issue while working on the Smart Assistant AI component in the CP2 A3P account. It‚Äôs a classic chicken-and-egg problem between the CDE and App teams when dealing with RCM and ASG dependencies. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve already documented a few ways we can potentially resolve this:

Pre-create RCM Stub: During AFT onboarding, create a placeholder RCM entry using a standard ASG naming convention. App teams can populate Chef roles later without needing the actual ASG.

Leverage SSM Parameter Store: Store app-level config (like Chef roles) in SSM. ASG launch templates can read from it at runtime, removing the tight dependency on RCM.

Use a Shared Config Registry: Maintain a simple config registry (S3, DynamoDB, or Git) with mappings like app ‚Üí ASG ‚Üí Chef role. This lets both teams work asynchronously.

Deterministic ASG Naming: Predict ASG names during AFT provisioning and inject them directly into RCM to unblock App teams early.

Happy to walk through these in more detail or collaborate on finalizing one of these as the standard flow.

üîÑ Problem Summary
CDE needs RCM (Resource Config Manager) data (like Chef roles) before provisioning ASG.

App teams need ASG and AWS Account info to onboard into RCM.

Thus, both teams are waiting on each other, blocking automation.

‚úÖ Solution Options
Option 1: Introduce a Placeholder or Stub RCM Entry Early
During AFT provisioning, auto-create a placeholder RCM entry with:

GitLab repo name

AWS Account ID

Predefined naming convention for ASG (e.g., asg-appname-env)

This allows App teams to update Chef roles without needing actual ASG provisioning first.

Once CDE provisions the ASG, it just aligns with the RCM entry already in place.

‚úÖ Pros: Breaks the loop
‚ö†Ô∏è Cons: Requires agreement on naming conventions and a small automation change in AFT

Option 2: Externalize Data Points to SSM Parameter Store (As Steve Suggests)
Have the HAPPI job or another upstream job:

Push Chef role metadata and app config to SSM Parameters using a predictable path like /rcm/{appname}/chef_role.

Let the ASG launch configuration read this at runtime.

‚úÖ Pros: Avoids RCM tight coupling
‚ö†Ô∏è Cons: Adds runtime dependency on SSM availability & permissions

Option 3: Use an Intermediate Configuration Registry
Create a lightweight internal service (e.g., S3 or DynamoDB registry or even a Git-backed config repo).

Store all mappings: app_name -> ASG name, account -> Chef role, etc.

Both teams write/read to this registry independently.

‚úÖ Pros: Loosely coupled, allows async workflows
‚ö†Ô∏è Cons: Adds another service/component to maintain

Option 4: Auto-Generate ASG Name and Inject to RCM
Let the AFT pipeline predict/generate ASG name using a deterministic pattern.

Push this ASG name and account ID directly into RCM at provisioning time (either by HAPPI or via a Git PR into RCM data store).

App teams can start onboarding immediately.

‚úÖ Pros: No manual handoff
‚ö†Ô∏è Cons: Needs strong naming convention discipline

üí° Recommended Hybrid Approach
Auto-generate ASG names and standardize naming convention in AFT outputs.

Pre-fill a stub RCM entry during AFT workspace creation.

Application teams fill in only the Chef role.

Let CDE pick this up without waiting.

Would you like me to mock a flow diagram or message you could send back summarizing this proposal for the thread?
